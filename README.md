Day 1 of the FC Game Jam 4. I selected a game title `Food Chain`. Set up some basic sprites (They'll need some lovin). 
Added a bit of game logic. So far so good. Need to continue implementing the matches and how to remove them from the board.

Finished up some of the game mechanics (selections and super powers now work). Added a meter to display roughly how many pairs exist. Implemented a level to win (8). Added a "win" screen. Added an "instructions" screen. Game is now "playable".
